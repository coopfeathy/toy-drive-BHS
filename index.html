                There is a <span class="bold">Toy Drive</span> being held to benefit the children at Arkansas Children's 
                Hospital-Northwest. The Toy Drive is sponsored by Farm Bureau in conjunction with the 
                <span class="gold">Bentonville Basketball Team</span>. All toys will be gathered throughout the week 
                and brought together at the first home game of the season against 
                <span class="navy">Greenwood High School</span>. Anything you can give would be appreciated greatly. 
                Please keep in mind that the toys are for <span class="bold">kids ages 0 to 18</span> and not just little 
                children.

                "At Arkansas Children’s, we not only make sick and injured kids better today, we also care for the entire family, with
                such services as <span class="italic">social work, child life, education and pastoral care</span>. Many of these needs are met through the
generosity of donors like you. Your gifts of <span class="italic">new toys, handmade items and other new gifts</span> go a long way toward
supporting families and brightening a hospital stay for a patient. Because the health and safety of our patients is our
#1 concern, we’ve developed several wish lists that meet our infection control standards".
